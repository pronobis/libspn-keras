Description: LibSPN
        ======
        
        LibSPN is a library for learning and inference with Sum-Product Networks. LibSPN
        is integrated with `TensorFlow <http://www.tensorflow.org>`_.
        
        
        What are SPNs?
        --------------
        
        Here we should add a few words about what SPNs are.
        
        
        Why LibSPN?
        -----------
        
        Several reasons:
        
        * LibSPN is a general-purpose library with a generic interface and tools for generating SPN structure, making it easy to apply SPNs to any domain/problem
        * LibSPN offers a simple Python interface for building or generating networks, learning, and inference, facilitating prototyping (e.g. in Jupyter) and enabling simple integration of SPNs with other software
        * LibSPN is integrated with TensorFlow, making it possible to combine SPNs with other deep learning methods
        * LibSPN uses concepts that should sound familiar to TensorFlow users (e.g. tensors, variables, feeding, queues, batching, TensorBoard etc.)
        * LibSPN leverages the power of TensorFlow to efficiently perform parallel computations on (multiple) GPU devices
        * LibSPN is extendable, making it easy to add custom operations and graph nodes
