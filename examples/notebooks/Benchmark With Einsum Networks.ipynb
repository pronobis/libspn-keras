    "# Bench-marking LibSPN-Keras against Einsum Networks\n",
    "Recently, [Peharz et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06231) proposed _Einsum Networks_, which are essentially SPNs with a specific implementation style. Einsum Networks implement a range of tricks that can be used to easily achieve tensor-based building of SPNs as well as EM learning through _autograd_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, `libspn-keras` already had the same tricks implemented _ever since it was made available_ (before the Einsum paper was published), and so it was straightforward to set up a side-by-side comparison of `libspn-keras` \n",
    "against the open-source implementation of Einsum Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Frameworks\n",
    "`libspn-keras` is available on PyPI and so we'll simply use `pip` to install it. For `Einsum` we'll need to clone its repo and add it to our `PATH`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The architecture is an SPN that recursively splits variables in two balanced groups starting at the root node. The groups are assigned randomly. Splitting is done up until a `depth` (in this case 5). After that, the remaining groups are combined through 'factorized input distributions'. This means that the binary leaf indicators are each weighted and the multiplied with the remaining nodes in a group. This is repeated `num_repetitions` times.\n"

In that sense, we are in no sense forced to use the same number of sums for every layer, nor a fixed number of 2 children per product. We can easily vary all of these parameters. Nevertheless, for the sake of comparison we'll reimplement the above architecture using `libspn-keras`.\n",
